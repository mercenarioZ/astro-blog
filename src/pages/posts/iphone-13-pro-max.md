Since October 2024, I have been using an iPhone 13 Pro Max as my main phone. 
I upgraded from an **iPhone 12 Pro Max**, I chose the iPhone 13 Pro Max because of the improved battery life, camera, and the **ProMotion** display, which I have been enjoying so far. 

I do not prefer iPhone 14 series (and the higher series) because of the notch, which has been replaced by a punch-hole display.
