This is my main keyboard, a custom aluminum keyboard with a hot-swappable PCB, the **Zuoya LMK81**. The switches behind are Akko Milky Yellow mixed with Fantasy Virus.
I have no clue about the keycaps, those keycaps are from my friend, and I have no idea about the brand or the model, lol. I love the Japanese characters on those tho.
